# Ansible Role for Arista CloudvisionÂ®
This repository contains several proof of concept scripts and modules that demonstrate the ability for CVP to integrate with other configuration management tools. This repository focuses specifically on CVP/Ansible integrations.

## Requirements
- [Arista Cloudvision (Version 2016.1.0 mimimum)](http://www.arista.com/en/products/eos/eos-cloudvision)
- [Cloudvision RestAPI Client (Version 0.7.0 minimum)](https://github.com/aristanetworks/cvprac)
- [Ansible (version 2.2 minimum)](https://github.com/ansible/ansible)

## Installation 
### Use Case 1: Ansible Controlled Configuration
#### Clone the ansible-cloudvision repo

```console
git clone https://github.com/arista-eosplus/ansible-cloudvision.git 
cd ansible-cloudvision
```
#### Setup the config.yml file from the auto_deploy script
```
cd auto_deploy
vi config.yml

---
cvp_host:
    - '<cvp host>'
cvp_user: <username>
cvp_pw: <password>
target_container: Ansible
provisioned_container: Provisioned
image: '<image bundle name>'
gw: '<default gateway address>'
subnet_mask: <subnet mask prefix len>
ansible_path: '<path to ansible-playbook>'
playbook: <playbook yaml file>

```

The `target_container` should match the name of the container thats configured for nodes to be placed in waiting after they have been bootrapped and are waiting for ansible to play a full configuration

The `provisoned_container` should match the name of the container thats configured for ansible-configure script to monitor

Note the same config file can be used for both the auto_deploy and the ansible_configure scripts

#### Install cronjobs 

The lines below will run the auto_deploy every minute and the ansible-configure script every 5 mintues
```console
* * * * * python /path/to/ansible-cloudvision/auto_deploy/auto_deploy.py
*/5 * * * * python /path/to/ansible-cloudvision/ansible_configure/ansible_configure.py
```

The `ansible_configure.py` script should be placed in the same directory with the playbook.  From there the normal Ansible convention can be used to obtain the neccesary needed for the configuration

### Use Case 2: Export CVP functionality to Ansible

#### Clone git repo
```console
git clone https://github.com/arista-eosplus/ansible-cloudvision.git
cd cvp_modules
```
#### Copy library/ and templates/ directory to local playbook directory
``` 
cp  library/ /path/to/ansible/playbook/
cp  templates/ /path/to/ansible/playbook/ 
```
At this point you will be able to use the cvp_server_provision module in the playbook run.
Please see the example test_server_provisoin.yml file for examples.

```
---
- hosts: cvp
  gather_facts: no
  connection: local

  tasks:
    - name: Create Container
      cv_container:
        host: "{{ cv_host }}"
        username: "{{ username }}"
        password: "{{ password }}"
